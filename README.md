# BinamPaper

Binam Paper is a work in progress dark gtk theme inspired by Paper GTK, and works well with the Paper GTK icons.

# How to use it

An easy way to do this use use lxappearance:
 - Save the theme (BinamPaper folder) under ~/.themes folder (create it if it doesn't exist)
 - Install and open lxappearance.
 - Select BinamPaper (lxappearance should automatically detect the theme since it's in the .themes folder in your home directory)
